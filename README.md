# coreutils-zig
This project aims to reimplement the GNU Coreutils in Zig. As of this moment it is nothing more than a hobby project and it serves as a playground for programming in Zig, testing the capabilities of the language.
The goal of the project is the implementation of all commands of the GNU Coreutils collection in Zig. In an ideal situation, this includes no dependency on libc.
